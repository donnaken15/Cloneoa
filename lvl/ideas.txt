0x00 - magic number (0x2)
????
0xXX - start pos (0x4)
0xXX - level type (0x1)
X - standard
1 - autoscroll
2 - board
0xXX - world gfx id (0x1)
0xXX - music id (0x1)
0 means nothing will play or >1 is music of worlds or level will look like solid colors
F or invalid numbers can be custom but more data will be needed

^ V might squash both of these things (sep.ly) into one byte and then do bitwise

object structure
0x00 - id
0 - item
1 - entity / controllable
2 - door
3 - sign
4 - level parts / tile
5 - background parts
0x01 - id of id (lol)
item:
0 - gem
1 - diamond
2 - heart
3 - star
4 - life
entity:
0 - enemy (red)
1 - enemy (green)
2 - box (based on red enemy)
3 - floating ball
5 - copter
4 - spike thing
5 - enemy bomb
door:
0 - finish door
1 - locked door
2 - linked warp
3 - pinball door lol
4 - switch door
level parts:
0 - ground
X - spike / damage
X - turbulance
X - switch
X - button
X - disappearing platforms
X - seesaw spring
X - breakable box
X - explosion redirection box
X - growing box
background parts:
X - fence <- make uncollidable tile instead
ground properties:
? - can rotate by switch
switch properties:
0 - standard
1 - toggle
1 - timed
2 - room rotater
0x02 - properties of object
0x08 - pos x
0x0C - pos y
expand object properties if sign with string

just thought about making two sectors in file, where ones all tiles and ones all objects
(V would be a little nifty for comments and other data)
0x04 - tileset sector pointer
0x04 - tileset sector size
0x04 - objects sector pointer
0x04 - objects sector size
or do
0x08 - tileset sector size
0x08 - objects sector size

6/19 big brain now
width, height
4/8 bits per level block or something
bitmap style

0 - air
1 - general ground (no texture)
2 - damage
3 - turbulance

4 - switch
5 - button
6 - disappearing platforms
7 - seesaw spring
8 - breakable box
9 - explosion redirection box
10 - growing box

or
4 - door
5 - next part or whatever lol

maybe put 2 or 4 bits to have ground or damage or
whatever properties and 4 or 6 bits are textures or something
when hibits are 0 make it ground
0b01 = damage
0b10 = something else
0b11 = scenery / background / uncollideable
maybe
