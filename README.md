## the Klonoa custom level engine project

The new project I barely started making gameplay for yet...

:/

Based purely on the hit GameBoy Advance<br/>
game of the series: [Empire of Dreams](https://www.google.com/search?q=Klonoa%3A+Empire+of+Dreams)

<sub>though I've only played up to World 1<br/>
when I played it as a kid .-.</sub>

<!--
lol

The reason I started this is simply...<br/>
<b><i>WHY HASN'T ANYONE DONE THIS</i></b>

For a game such as this, you would expect<br/>
some custom content, but apparently not.<br/>
<i>Well, that's about to change.</i-->
